Each event has a limited number of tickets available, and users can purchase tickets if they are still available. You need to track which users have purchased tickets for specific events and how many are still available. What data structure would you use for this task, and why?\n\n**Example data:**\n- Available tickets: `{\"Concert\": 100, \"Football Game\": 50, \"Theater Show\": 75}`\n- Purchasers: `{\"Concert\": [\"John\", \"Emily\"], \"Football Game\": [\"Alex\"], \"Theater Show\": [\"Sam\", \"John\"]}`\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Choose a data structure to track ticket availability and purchasers efficiently.\n2. Write a program that handles ticket purchases and updates the list of purchasers.\n3. Implement functions to check availability and view who has purchased tickets.\n<hr>",
